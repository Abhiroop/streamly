## Stream`ing` `Concurrent`ly

Streamly, short for streaming concurrently, provides monadic streams, with a
simple API, almost identical to standard lists, and an in-built support for
concurrency.  By using stream-style combinators on stream composition,
streams can be generated, merged, chained, mapped, zipped, and consumed
concurrently â€“ providing a generalized high level programming framework
unifying streaming and concurrency. Controlled concurrency allows even infinite
streams to be evaluated concurrently.  Concurrency is auto scaled based on
feedback from the stream consumer.  The programmer does not have to be aware of
threads, locking or synchronization to write scalable concurrent programs.

The basic streaming functionality of streamly is equivalent to that provided by
streaming libraries like
[vector](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/vector),
[streaming](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/streaming),
[pipes](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes), and
[conduit](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/conduit).
In addition to providing streaming functionality, streamly subsumes
the functionality of list transformer libraries like `pipes` or
[list-t](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/list-t), and also the logic
programming library [logict](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/logict). On
the concurrency side, it subsumes the functionality of the
[async](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/async) package. Because it supports
streaming with concurrency we can write FRP applications similar in concept to
[Yampa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/Yampa) or
[reflex](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/reflex).

Why use streamly?

  * _Simplicity_: Simple list like streaming API, if you know how to use lists
    then you know how to use streamly. This library is built with simplicity
    and ease of use as a design goal.
  * _Concurrency_: Simple, powerful, and scalable concurrency.  Concurrency is
    built-in, and not intrusive, concurrent programs are written exactly the
    same way as non-concurrent ones.
  * _Generality_: Unifies functionality provided by several disparate packages
    (streaming, concurrency, list transformer, logic programming, reactive
    programming) in a concise API.
  * _Performance_: Streamly is designed for high performance. It employs stream
    fusion optimizations for best possible performance. Serial peformance is
    equivalent to the venerable `vector` library in most cases and even better
    in some cases.  Concurrent performance is unbeatable.  See
    [streaming-benchmarks](https://github.com/composewell/streaming-benchmarks)
    for a comparison of popular streaming libraries on micro-benchmarks.

The following chart shows a summary of the cost of key streaming operations
processing a million elements. The timings for streamly and vector are in the
600-700 microseconds range and therefore can barely be seen in the graph.

## Streaming Pipelines

Unlike `pipes` or `conduit` and like `vector` and `streaming`, `streamly`
composes stream data instead of stream processors (functions).  A stream is
just like a list and is explicitly passed around to functions that process the
stream.  Therefore, no special operator is needed to join stages in a streaming
pipeline, just the standard function application (`$`) or reverse function
application (`&`) operator is enough.  Combinators are provided in
`Streamly.Prelude` to transform or fold streams.

The following snippet provides a simple stream composition example that reads
numbers from stdin, prints the squares of even numbers and exits if an even
number more than 9 is entered.

``` haskell
import Streamly
import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S
import Data.Function ((&))

main = runStream $
       S.repeatM getLine
     & fmap read
     & S.filter even
     & S.takeWhile (<= 9)
     & fmap (\x -> x * x)
     & S.mapM print
```

## Concurrent Stream Generation

Monadic construction and generation functions e.g. `consM`, `unfoldrM`,
`replicateM`, `repeatM`, `iterateM` and `fromFoldableM` etc. work concurrently
when used with appropriate stream type combinator (e.g. `asyncly`, `aheadly` or
`parallely`).

The following code finishes in 3 seconds (6 seconds when serial):

``` haskell
> let p n = threadDelay (n * 1000000) >> return n
> S.toList $ aheadly $ p 3 |: p 2 |: p 1 |: S.nil
[3,2,1]

> S.toList $ parallely $ p 3 |: p 2 |: p 1 |: S.nil
[1,2,3]
```

The following finishes in 10 seconds (100 seconds when serial):

``` haskell
runStream $ asyncly $ S.replicateM 10 $ p 10
```

## Concurrent Streaming Pipelines

Use `|&` or `|$` to apply stream processing functions concurrently. The
following example prints a "hello" every second; if you use `&` instead of
`|&` you will see that the delay doubles to 2 seconds instead because of serial
application.

``` haskell
main = runStream $
      S.repeatM (threadDelay 1000000 >> return "hello")
   |& S.mapM (\x -> threadDelay 1000000 >> putStrLn x)
```

## Mapping Concurrently

We can use `mapM` or `sequence` functions concurrently on a stream.

``` haskell
> let p n = threadDelay (n * 1000000) >> return n
> runStream $ aheadly $ S.mapM (\x -> p 1 >> print x) (serially $ repeatM (p 1))
```

## Serial and Concurrent Merging

Semigroup and Monoid instances can be used to fold streams serially or
concurrently. In the following example we compose ten actions in the
stream, each with a delay of 1 to 10 seconds, respectively. Since all the
actions are concurrent we see one output printed every second:

``` haskell
import Streamly
import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S
import Control.Concurrent (threadDelay)

main = S.toList $ parallely $ foldMap delay [1..10]
 where delay n = S.yieldM $ threadDelay (n * 1000000) >> print n
```

Streams can be combined together in many ways. We provide some examples
below, see the tutorial for more ways. We use the following `delay`
function in the examples to demonstrate the concurrency aspects:

``` haskell
import Streamly
import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S
import Control.Concurrent

delay n = S.yieldM $ do
    threadDelay (n * 1000000)
    tid <- myThreadId
    putStrLn (show tid ++ ": Delay " ++ show n)
```
### Serial

``` haskell
main = runStream $ delay 3 <> delay 2 <> delay 1
```
```
ThreadId 36: Delay 3
ThreadId 36: Delay 2
ThreadId 36: Delay 1
```

### Parallel

``` haskell
main = runStream . parallely $ delay 3 <> delay 2 <> delay 1
```
```
ThreadId 42: Delay 1
ThreadId 41: Delay 2
ThreadId 40: Delay 3
```

## Nested Loops (aka List Transformer)

The monad instance composes like a list monad.

``` haskell
import Streamly
import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S

loops = do
    x <- S.fromFoldable [1,2]
    y <- S.fromFoldable [3,4]
    S.yieldM $ putStrLn $ show (x, y)

main = runStream loops
```
```
(1,3)
(1,4)
(2,3)
(2,4)
```

## Concurrent Nested Loops

To run the above code with, lookahead style concurrency i.e. each iteration in
the loop can run run concurrently by but the results are presented in the same
order as serial execution:

``` haskell
main = runStream $ aheadly $ loops
```

To run it with depth first concurrency yielding results asynchronously in the
same order as they become available (deep async composition):

``` haskell
main = runStream $ asyncly $ loops
```

To run it with breadth first concurrency and yeilding results asynchronously
(wide async composition):

``` haskell
main = runStream $ wAsyncly $ loops
```

The above streams provide lazy/demand-driven concurrency which is automatically
scaled as per demand and is controlled/bounded so that it can be used on
infinite streams. The following combinator provides strict, unbounded
concurrency irrespective of demand:

``` haskell
main = runStream $ parallely $ loops
```

To run it serially but interleaving the outer and inner loop iterations
(breadth first serial):

``` haskell
main = runStream $ wSerially $ loops
```

## Magical Concurrency

Streams can perform semigroup (<>) and monadic bind (>>=) operations
concurrently using combinators like `asyncly`, `parallelly`. For example,
to concurrently generate squares of a stream of numbers and then concurrently
sum the square roots of all combinations of two streams:

``` haskell
import Streamly
import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S

main = do
    s <- S.sum $ asyncly $ do
        -- Each square is performed concurrently, (<>) is concurrent
        x2 <- foldMap (\x -> return $ x * x) [1..100]
        y2 <- foldMap (\y -> return $ y * y) [1..100]
        -- Each addition is performed concurrently, monadic bind is concurrent
        return $ sqrt (x2 + y2)
    print s
```

Of course, the actions running in parallel could be arbitrary IO actions.  For
example, to concurrently list the contents of a directory tree recursively:

``` haskell
import Path.IO (listDir, getCurrentDir)
import Streamly
import qualified Streamly.Prelude as S

main = runStream $ aheadly $ getCurrentDir >>= readdir
   where readdir d = do
            (dirs, files) <- S.yieldM $ listDir d
            S.yieldM $ mapM_ putStrLn $ map show files
            -- read the subdirs concurrently, (<>) is concurrent
            foldMap readdir dirs
```

In the above examples we do not think in terms of threads, locking or
synchronization, rather we think in terms of what can run in parallel, the rest
is taken care of automatically. When using `aheadly` the programmer does
not have to worry about how many threads are to be created, they are
automatically adjusted based on the demand of the consumer.

The concurrency facilities provided by streamly can be compared with
[OpenMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenMP) and
[Cilk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cilk) but with a more declarative
expression.

## Rate Limiting

For bounded concurrent streams, stream yield rate can be specified. For
example, to print hello once every second you can simply write this:

``` haskell
import Streamly
import Streamly.Prelude as S

main = runStream $ asyncly $ avgRate 1 $ S.repeatM $ putStrLn "hello"
```

For some practical uses of rate control, see
[AcidRain.hs](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/tree/master/examples/AcidRain.hs)
and
[CirclingSquare.hs](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/tree/master/examples/CirclingSquare.hs)
.
Concurrency of the stream is automatically controlled to match the specified
rate. Rate control works precisely even at throughputs as high as millions of
yields per second. For more sophisticated rate control see the haddock
documentation.

## Reactive Programming (FRP)

Streamly is a foundation for first class reactive programming as well by virtue
of integrating concurrency and streaming. See
[AcidRain.hs](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/tree/master/examples/AcidRain.hs)
for a console based FRP game example and
[CirclingSquare.hs](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/tree/master/examples/CirclingSquare.hs)
for an SDL based animation example.

## Comparison with the `async` package

Streamly provides higher level concurrency compared to the `async` package, it
can be used wherever you would want to use the `async` package. [See this
tutorial for a quick comparison of streamly with
async](https://github.com/composewell/streamly/blob/master/docs/Async.md).
